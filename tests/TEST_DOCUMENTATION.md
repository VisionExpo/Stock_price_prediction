# Stock Price Prediction Model Testing Documentation

This document provides an overview of the testing framework and results for the Stock Price Prediction LSTM model.

## Testing Framework

The testing framework is organized into three main categories:

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and functions
2. **Integration Tests**: Test the interaction between components
3. **Performance Tests**: Evaluate model performance and tune hyperparameters

## Running Tests

You can run the tests using the `run_tests.py` script:

```bash
# Run all tests
python tests/run_tests.py --all

# Run only unit tests
python tests/run_tests.py --unit

# Run only integration tests
python tests/run_tests.py --integration

# Run basic performance tests
python tests/run_tests.py --performance basic

# Run hyperparameter tuning
python tests/run_tests.py --performance hyperparameter

# Run model comparison
python tests/run_tests.py --performance comparison

# Run all performance tests
python tests/run_tests.py --performance all
```

## Test Results

### Unit Tests

Unit tests verify that individual components of the system work as expected. These tests focus on:

- Data preprocessing functions
- Model building and prediction functions
- Utility functions for metrics calculation

### Integration Tests

Integration tests verify that the components work together correctly. These tests focus on:

- The complete pipeline from data loading to prediction
- Future prediction functionality

### Performance Tests

Performance tests evaluate the model's accuracy and efficiency. These tests include:

1. **Basic Model Performance**:
   - Tests the model on real stock data
   - Calculates performance metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE)
   - Generates performance plots

2. **Model Comparison**:
   - Compares model performance across different stocks
   - Tests different look-back periods
   - Identifies the best configuration for each stock

3. **Hyperparameter Tuning**:
   - Tests different combinations of hyperparameters
   - Identifies the optimal configuration
   - Analyzes the impact of each hyperparameter on model performance

## Performance Metrics

The model is evaluated using the following metrics:

- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Average of squared differences between predicted and actual values
- **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: Square root of MSE, provides error in the same unit as the target variable
- **MAE (Mean Absolute Error)**: Average of absolute differences between predicted and actual values
- **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: Average of percentage differences between predicted and actual values

## Test Reports

After running the tests, a test report is generated in the `tests/performance/results/` directory. The report includes:

- Timestamp of the test run
- Status of unit tests (passed/failed)
- Status of integration tests (passed/failed)
- Status of performance tests (passed/failed)
- Overall test status

## Performance Results

The performance test results are saved in the `tests/performance/results/` directory and include:

- CSV files with performance metrics
- Plots of actual vs. predicted prices
- Training history plots
- Hyperparameter tuning results

## Interpreting Results

When interpreting the test results, consider the following:

1. **Lower is better** for all error metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE, MAPE)
2. **MAPE provides a percentage error** that is easier to interpret
3. **Training time** is important for real-time applications
4. **Look-back period** significantly affects prediction accuracy
5. **Hyperparameter tuning** can substantially improve model performance

## Recommended Configuration

Based on extensive testing, the recommended configuration for the LSTM model is:

- **Look-back period**: 60 days
- **LSTM units**: 50
- **Dropout rate**: 0.2
- **Batch size**: 32
- **Epochs**: 100
- **Learning rate**: 0.001

This configuration provides a good balance between accuracy and training time for most stocks.

## Future Improvements

Based on the test results, the following improvements could be made:

1. **Implement early stopping** to prevent overfitting
2. **Add more features** beyond just closing prices
3. **Test different model architectures** (GRU, Bidirectional LSTM)
4. **Implement ensemble methods** to improve prediction accuracy
5. **Add cross-validation** for more robust evaluation
