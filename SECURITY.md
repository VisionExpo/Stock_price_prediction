## Security Best Practices for Users

1. **API Keys**: Never share your Tiingo API key or commit it to version control. Always use environment variables or secure vaults to store sensitive credentials.

2. **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies to ensure you have the latest security patches.

3. **Data Privacy**: Be aware that stock data and predictions may be subject to financial regulations in your jurisdiction.
